# This is one of my biggest projects yet.
The challenge was to create a simple dealership inside a Java program, which need to contains 3 type of vehicles: Fusca, Brasilia and Opala, it also need to contains 4 types of models: 
```
 Basic, Sedan, Sport and Executive.
 ```
Then it should ask the user if they want to add additional parts, such as:
```
Eletric Trio, AC, Hydraulic steering, Leather seats and Multidia.
```
<br>
There was a couple of extra observations too:
<br>
The Sedan models already contains the Eletric Trio and AC, so they cant add those.
<br>
The Sport and Executive models can only add Multimidia.
<br>
<br>
The Fusca price table is: 
```
Basic - R$20k;
Sedan - R$27k; 
Sport - R$28,5k;
Executive - R$32k. 
<br>
<br>
Brasilia price table: Basic - R$20k; Sedan - R$27,9k; Sport - R$30,5k; Executive - R$35k.
<br>
<br>
The Opala price table is: 
Basic - R$25k; Sedan - R$29,2k; Sport - R$31,5k; Executive - R$37k.
<br>
<br>
The vehicle can have up to two additional parts, with no duplicates.
