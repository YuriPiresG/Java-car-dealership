# This is one of my biggest projects yet, the challenge was to create a simple dealership inside a Java program, which need to contains 3 type of vehicles: Fusca, Brasilia and Opala, it also need to contains 4 types of models: Basic, Sedan, Sport and Executive, then it should ask the user if they want to add additional parts, such as: Eletric Trio, AC, Hydraulic steering, Leather seats and Multidia. There was a couple of extra observations too: The Sedan models already contains the Eletric Trio and AC, so they cant add those. The Sport and Executive models can only add Multimidia. The Fusca price table is: Basic - R0k; Sedan - R7k; Sport - R8,5k; Executive - R2k. Brasilia price table: Basic - R0k; Sedan - R7k; Sport - R0,5k; Executive - R5k. The Opala price table is:Basic - R5k; Sedan - R9,2k; Sport - R1,5k; Executive - R7k. The vehicle can have up to two additional parts, with no duplicates.
